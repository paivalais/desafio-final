# How To Contribute
## Introduction
The NGINX Ingress Controller makes use of the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator.

Documentation is stored within the `docs/` subfolder of the main repository, and is where `hugo` commands should be run.

Hugo will watch and reload any changes made, so you can review your work in real time.

## Set-up
**Requirements**
* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

**Quick Start**
```
git clone git@github.com:nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress.git
